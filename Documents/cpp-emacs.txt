https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8656/usr-bin-vs-usr-local-bin-on-linux
where to install in linux. There is great answer in that thread.

https://gitlab.com/Preisschild/popcorntime-flatpak
it was possible to install it by using that page instructions.
flatpack-build and some other packages were installed in that process too

flatpack & snap allowed me to install acestream and few more, can't remember which (keepass maybe)

i3wm found this process after trying to run d-loaded torrent by clicking on it
/app/popcorntime/Popcorn-Time --type=zygote --no-sandbox --enable-crash-reporter=, --user-data-dir=/home/zoran/.var/app/sh.popcorntime.PopcornTime/config/Popcorn-Time

To keep torrent files to open Popcorn-Time as default application is the way to go as far as popcorn is concerned on i3wm.

process of making emacs into c and c++ editor

in short

I had to install also all of these in order to get rid of error messages
clang-devel (not sure if this one changed anything but kept it anyway)
llvm-devel
zlib-devel
openssl-devel
cppunit
cppunit-devel

then comes flycheck and rest of emacs packages


CLANG & LLVM
Use this pages for clang and llvm insallation, else you get errors if installing clang and llvm from dnf install command line.
But in order to get it work
install first clang sudo dnf install clang
http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html
make takes long time. very long. Probably more than an hour.
more than three hours in reality. very long.

RTAGS
https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags/wiki/Installing-RTags
https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags
Tried both ways to cmake and got errors realting to llvm-config and some cxx cmake flags.

I finally got llvm-config. I needed to install llvm-devel instead of llvm. 
By installing llvm-devel I got rid of llvm-config not found error and also smake falgs missing error
I am still getting

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!    
As explained in following text in order to get rid of that error I had to compile in rtags directory and not in rtags/build as I was trying.
then I tried to install clang-devel package but error persits.
clang-devel took very short time to install from web.I did not have to compile as when I installed clang.

Moved away from build directory and ke  exaxtly as in
https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags#finding-clang
Now it found the file but threw new errors/warnings

I installed cppunit and cppunit-devel (in that order since i had trouble finding cppunit-devel cause i foolishly searched for cppunit-dev)

!!!How am I ever to upgrade this?
And I just finished rtags cmake.
make finished in short time. Not like for llvm.

I followed through the rest of
https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags
and managd to use rtags-find-reference on the file provided. Well at least I managed to use it somewhat, I don't really understand yet how to navigate through.

installed flycheck through use-package in emace, but did not configure any sytax checking 

did not install auto-complete-clang

Installed company and now i have what looks to me as completion.

suffering with levenshtein-0 dependency. 
https://github.com/atilaneves/cmake-ide/issues/66
I needed melpa instead of stable melpa repository and levenshtein was installed

I guess next is CMake.

I did not install rtags?!?! wtf But then I get some mismatch rdm and rc....
It looks I did not have to since I installed one from github and it is in ~/.local/rtags/bin/rdm


Managed to get rdm.socket to listen but stil rdm.service does not start
Followd systemd configuration in https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags/wiki/Setup
and added few lines in ~./bashrc
RDM=/home/.local/rtags/bin/rdm
export RDM

When starting emacs with auto start rdm option (rtags-start-process-unless-running) I get an error
Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/zoran/.emacs.d/init.el’:

error: RTags: Can’t start the process ‘nil’. Please check the value of the variables ‘rtags-path’ and ‘rtags-rdm-binary-name’.

To ensure normal operation, you should investigate and remove the
cause of the error in your initialization file.  Start Emacs with
the ‘--debug-init’ option to view a complete error backtrace.

I will try to change this variable in rtags.el file
(defcustom rtags-path nil
  "Path to RTags executables."
  :type '(choice (const :tag "Unset" nil) directory)
  :risky t
Changed rtags-path variable in rtags.el to ~/.config/systemd/user/rdm.service and it works now.
check what actually works
~/.local/rtags/bin worked as rtags-path variable invoked with C-h v
and in 
(defcustom rtags-path nil
is
(defcustom rtags-path t
now


Irony was not working as expected
i had to add lines
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
(add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
(add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options)
from https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode
and build irony-server with M-x irony-install-server

Could not get normal looking completion so I installed yasnippet and yasnippet-snippets
Well, I got some C/C++ definitions but I am not sure that is it.
Actually after adding some lines in init.el (load-path) it looked somewhat better with .c and .cpp test file. 

I finally instaled auto-complete-clang and followed instructions on web page https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang
Not sure if I needed 
(setq ac-clang-flags
      (mapcar (lambda (item)(concat "-I" item))
              (split-string
               "

CapsLock in i3
Had to change ~/.Xmodmap and add text found on Arch web site.
I also changed dip-switch on keyboard as well as changed key-cap, so instead of Caps_Lock now it is written Ctrl.


Mapped volume keys in ~/.config/i3/config file.


Added this to yasnippet config in ~/.emacs.d/init.el and got C header completion.

Safire was recognized, but profile given was 7.1 instead of stereo so some sources do not work correctly.
pacmd command was first to use https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/my-external-sound-card-is-recognized-as-speaker-but-not-mike-4175626011/

Following page has a howto for focusrite problem reg. stereo output. 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/450489/pulseaudio-card-profile-for-focusrite-scarlett-18i8

Yes you can create a pulseaudio profile to get the Focusrite 18i8 working in stereo.

Create the file /lib/udev/rules.d/91-pulseaudio.rules:

SUBSYSTEM!="sound", GOTO="pulseaudio1_end"
ACTION!="change", GOTO="pulseaudio1_end"
KERNEL!="card*", GOTO="pulseaudio1_end"

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1235", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8014", ENV{PULSE_PROFILE_SET}="focusrite-18i8.conf"

LABEL="pulseaudio1_end"
And create the file /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/focusrite-18i8.conf:

[General]
auto-profiles = no

[Mapping analog-out]
description = Analog Outputs
device-strings = hw:%f
channel-map = left,right,aux0,aux1,aux2,aux3,aux4,aux5
direction = output

[Mapping analog-in]
description = Analog Inputs
device-strings = hw:%f
channel-map = left,right,aux0,aux1,aux2,aux3,aux4,aux5,aux6,aux7,aux8,aux9,aux10,aux11,aux12,aux13,aux14,aux15
direction = input

[Profile output:analog-out+input:analog-in]
description = Analog Stereo
output-mappings = analog-out
input-mappings = analog-in
Then either restart the machine or run the commands:

sudo udevadm trigger -ssound

pulseaudio -k

In response to @Sneetsher: The Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 now seems to work well with Linux 3.19 and newer. The internal mixer can be configured with alsamixer and the settings can be saved using sudo alsactl store. It is also possible to change other settings (such as the impedance of the inputs between instrument (Hi-Z) and line level, or to switch the inputs' pad between 0 and -10dB) using alsamixer.

!!! about sigrok and pulseview
I had to install proprietary sigrok firmware since I could no power my board with
dnf install sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw from https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw

I had to use sigrok-fwextract-saleae-logic16 file (create and write it) in order to extract firmware from sealae sw Logic+1.1.34+(64-bit).zip
parseelf.py had to be created as well.
Then was Logic directory copied to /usr/share/sigrok-firmware folder and sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw Logic command executed.
why i used older software saelase https://sigrok.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=989
from https://support.saleae.com/logic-software/legacy-software/older-software-releases
and finally this is what I downloaded in order to extract the firmware https://sigrok.org/gitweb/?p=sigrok-util.git;a=tree;f=firmware/saleae-logic16;h=4599fd9bda1f547957c9ea5bf69c980b80110029;hb=HEAD
some more info https://sigrok.org/wiki/Saleae_Logic16/Firmware
and some more https://sigrok.org/wiki/Saleae_Logic16#Firmware where under Firmware heading is explanation how to extract that mentioned proprietary firmware.
Following is original page describing free software capabilities https://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw and here I can see that saleae19 is not supported, but saleae8 seem to be OK. So that is probably what I have to buy in order to make video as help for the course.
!!!!!!!!!!
Take a look here https://sigrok.org/wiki/Mcupro_Logic16_clone#Firmware
It might be possible to avoid proprietary software. Look at the bottom of the page, renaming the firmware.
Must check, but might still have to purchase cheaper solutions since this one (100 MHz that I have) is around 500 SEK plus.

Adding second GPU
Use radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1 to override.
that was message found in dmesg command. other usefull commands
tree /sys/bus/pci/drivers/amdgpu/
tree /sys/bus/pci/drivers/radeon/
lspci -vnn | grep VGA -A24
echo -n "0000:08:00.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/radeon/unbind  !!this worked only when i disabled windows manager with opened ctrl-alt-3 or so
systemctl stop gd then tab I think
but still could not assign (bind) to new driver
echo -n "0000:08:00.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/amdgpu/bind

Now check if
Use radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1 to override.
is all that is needed.
radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1"

[root@workstation fedora]# cat /etc/default/grub

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1"
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg  !!!ths is for updating grub on fedora (strange people, making it more difficult than needed)
It worked.
end GPU
next is how to force output to new (second) card for the host and leave original card for guests on the system.
I connected cables to the card and output started just fine but disappeared once I logged in i3wm


following is from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16407/how-to-check-which-gpu-is-active-in-linux
following output shows which card is in charge
[zoran@workstation ~]$ glxinfo|egrep "OpenGL vendor|OpenGL renderer"
OpenGL vendor string: X.Org
OpenGL renderer string: Radeon RX 580 Series (POLARIS10, DRM 3.30.0, 5.1.8-300.fc30.x86_64, LLVM 8.0.0)
[zoran@workstation ~]$ 

and following shows that both cards are active since both have [VGA controller] at the end of output
[zoran@workstation ~]$ lspci -vnnn | perl -lne 'print if /^\d+\:.+(\[\S+\:\S+\])/' | grep VGA
08:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Pitcairn PRO [Radeon HD 7850 / R7 265 / R9 270 1024SP] [1002:6819] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
42:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Ellesmere [Radeon RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590] [1002:67df] (rev e7) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
[zoran@workstation ~]$ 

So what is left is to figure out how to change one in charge to the other one. 

Guess what, "Southern Islands" graphics processor (which is the gpu in question) has only experimental support in amdgpu driver. It looks if I wish to use that card as main Linux card I will have to switch back to radeon driver. Or maybe i can first try to pass that card to Windows 10 and or whatever else OS I might be using with that card.

CHANGES, CHANGES!!!
I followed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df0QooIV83A  mostly
but used arch recommended link (recommended from looking glass site) and got bit confused. It looks to me they lack real howto and I did not apply their vfio.conf file since it looks I achieved needed by pci-stub entry in grub. 
I also looked at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yhwJxWSqXI&t=624s but did not really follow his path besides I think iommu=1 entry in grub.
I changed the grub file
First. I added iommu=1 amd_iommu=ON rebuild the grub and reboted.
Second. Removed the entry relating to radeon vs amdgpu driver rebuild grub and rebooted. Result was that Radeon 7850 got radeon driver back.
Third. Added entry to block 7850
This is how grub looks after that. Of course I rebuilt it and reboot it and result is also visible, 
[root@workstation zoran]# cat /etc/default/grub
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="iommu=1 amd_iommu=on iommu=pt"

GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true

radeon7850 is using pci-stub driver. And I think it is exactly what i need.

[root@workstation build]# 

After the last step make worked. I have looking-glass-client in build directory.
This was pain and I installed so much stuff, I am not sure it will not make some issues down the road.
More I am thinking about this more assured I am becoming that new install will be needed, especially if I intend documenting it one the web.
I have to take a look at backup possibility so when experimenting I can step back and undo whatever changes to system and personal files I did.
If and when re-install don't forget to change file system and for God's sake don't forger to git this document.
